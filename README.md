# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) in Python

This project focuses on performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using Python. The goal is to analyze and visualize the provided dataset to gain insights and understand the relationships between variables. The analysis includes both **univariate** and **bivariate** techniques, leveraging popular Python libraries.

### 1. **Univariate Analysis**
   Univariate analysis involves examining one variable at a time to uncover patterns in the data. Techniques and visualizations used:
   - **Histograms** to observe the distribution of numeric variables.
   - **Bar Charts** for categorical variables.
   - **Box Plots** to identify data spread and outliers.

### 2. **Bivariate Analysis**
   Bivariate analysis looks at relationships between two variables. Techniques and visualizations used:
   - **Scatter Plots** to identify relationships between numeric variables.
   - **Heatmaps** to examine correlations.
   - **Pair Plots** to visualize relationships between multiple variables.
   - **Box Plots** and **Violin Plots** for comparing distributions.

## Dataset
The dataset used for analysis is included in the repository under the `data/` folder. The dataset contains multiple features that are explored in detail through the analysis.
